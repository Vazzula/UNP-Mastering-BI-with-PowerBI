**OVERVIEW:**
The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's workforce, exploring various demographic, financial, and tenure-related factors. It is divided into multiple sections, covering aspects such as age range, gender, education field, department, monthly income, salary hikes, and tenure. The visualizations effectively highlight patterns in workforce distribution and attrition dynamics, offering actionable insights.
The analysis reveals that the workforce is predominantly male, with 60% of employees being men compared to 40% women. Employees are distributed across three primary departments: Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales, with Research & Development having the largest share. In terms of income, the majority of employees fall within the $0–$5k and $5k–$10k monthly income brackets, indicating a focus on mid-level earners.

Further insights from the second page reveal that job involvement and job/environment satisfaction play a critical role in reducing attrition. As these factors increase, attrition decreases, indicating an inverse correlation. Surprisingly, gender does not significantly impact attrition, with less than a 3% variation observed. However, marital status and age range significantly affect attrition, with clear trends emerging. Additionally, geographic distance from the office has a direct correlation with attrition, with employees living farther away more likely to leave the organization.

The third page focuses on financial factors, education fields, experience, and tenure. Employees with backgrounds in Human Resources, Technical Degrees, and Marketing form the majority of the workforce, providing an opportunity for targeted retention strategies in these groups. Attrition is notably higher among employees with 0–2 years of total working experience, with a rate of 43.9%. As experience increases, attrition rates decline, indicating that experience and tenure contribute to employee stability.

Interestingly, salary hike percentages do not appear to significantly influence attrition, suggesting that financial incentives alone may not be sufficient to retain employees. Instead, factors such as work-life balance, satisfaction, and organizational culture may play a more substantial role. Additionally, employees with longer tenures in their roles or under the same managers exhibit lower attrition, reflecting a correlation between loyalty and reduced turnover.

In summary, the dashboard provides a detailed understanding of workforce trends and attrition dynamics. Key takeaways include the importance of job satisfaction, the influence of demographics such as marital status and geographic distance, and the limited impact of salary hikes on retention. These insights can guide the organization in developing targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
